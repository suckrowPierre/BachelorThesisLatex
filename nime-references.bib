	abstract = {Sound is an essential medium for human-computer interaction and vital for applications such as games and music production software. In the audio industry, C++ is the dominating programming language. This talk provides an insight into the patterns and tools that C++ developers in the audio industry rely on. There are interesting lessons to be learned from this domain that can be useful to every C++ developer.

Handling audio in real time presents interesting technical challenges. Techniques also used in other C++ domains have to be combined: real-time multithreading, lock-free programming, efficient {DSP}, {SIMD}, and low-latency hardware communication. C++ is the language of choice to tie all these requirements together. Clever leveraging of advanced C++ techniques, template metaprogramming, and the new C++11/14 standard makes these tasks more exciting than ever.

Timur Doumler is Senior Software Developer at London-based technology company {ROLI}. He is working with Julian Storer to further develop {JUCE}, the leading cross-platform framework for creating audio applications that is used by hundreds of companies in the audio industry.

After five years of writing high-performance code in Fortran, C, and C++ for numerical simulations of the cosmic structure formation, Timur became committed to audio and music production software. Before joining {ROLI}, he worked on various projects at market-leading company Native Instruments, such as {KONTAKT}, the industry standard sampling platform used by the majority of music producers and composers for film score, games, and contemporary popular music.

Timur holds a {PhD} in astrophysics and is passionate about well-written code, modern C++ techniques, science-fiction, learning languages, and progressive rock music.},
